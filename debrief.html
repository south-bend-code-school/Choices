<h2>Why we do what we do:</h2>

  <div>
    Our app is called "Choices" because we are trying to counter the notion that people decide to be homeless or that it is their fault when that is often not the case.
  </div>

<h2>Our Mission:</h2>

  <div>
We hope to raise awareness about the homeless community in South Bend and offer a way for people to give to charities that support those in that community.
